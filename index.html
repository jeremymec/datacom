        <h2>Hi,</h2>
      </header>
      <section class="entry-content">
        <p>My name is Jeremy Mechen and I love building things. I'm a third year student studying Software Engineering
          at Victoria University down in Wellington. I've always loved technology,
          but what solidified my decision to pursue a career in software engineering was the chance to spend my life
          creating stuff that other people <b>want</b> to use.
          TalentX sounds like an amazing opportunity to have a great weekend collaborating with like minded people to
          build something cool, and I'd love to be a part of it!

      <p>My favorite tool to mess around with recently has been Ruby on Rails, mainly because of how easy it is to get a
        powerful fullstack application up and running.
        Take a look at this version of hangman I made in rails last year.
